src/hooks/useCadastros.ts(21,21): error TS2352: Conversion of type 'GenericStringError[]' to type 'T[]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'GenericStringError' is not comparable to type 'T'.
    'T' could be instantiated with an arbitrary type which could be unrelated to 'GenericStringError'.
